# Program Instructions
`rm -rf *.class; javac temp/Jacksonville.java; java temp/Jacksonville;`


## WHY do this?
Packaging allows use of a directory structure with java programs.

**To DO** 
1) example will have more to come where folder organization does not dictate access to classes or variables. Instead if that will be restricted inheritance and public vs private should maintain that logic.

2) Interfaces that do not require an instance also staged for this project.
